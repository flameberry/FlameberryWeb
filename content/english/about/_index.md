I am a Third Year Computer Engineering Student studying in Vivekanand Education Society's Institute of Technology, located at Mumbai, India. My core interest is in C++ and detailed software systems, which contain processes like setting up a build system, designing the software architecture, writing professional code, packaging the software, and creating the documentation for the same.


I am the sole developer of the Flameberry Game Engine as of now, and it has been under development since 2021. I started it as an inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno">The Cherno YouTube Channel</a>. Ever since then I have continued to develop this Game Engine, add features like 3D rendering, Cascaded Shadow Mapping, Nvidia PhysX, C# Scripting using Microsoft Dotnet, etc. independently of The Cherno's Game Engine Series, as it is limited to 2D.
